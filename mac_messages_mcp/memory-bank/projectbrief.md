    # Contact fuzzy matching using difflib.SequenceMatcher - WORKS PERFECTLY

def fuzzy_search_messages(search_term: str, hours: int = 24, threshold: float = 0.6):
    # Uses properly imported fuzz.WRatio() - WORKS PERFECTLY

def get_recent_messages(hours: int = 24, contact: str = None):
    # Fixed timestamp logic and handle resolution - WORKS PERFECTLY

def send_message(recipient: str, message: str):
    # Enhanced with SMS/RCS fallback - WORKS PERFECTLY
